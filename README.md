# Digital Forensics

This course addresses the collection and analysis of the digital footprint left by humans and computers in a way that is reproducible by third-parties and suitable for presentation to a non-specialist audience. Topics include the rules of evidence, preservation of data, file system forensics, network forensics, live forensics, anti-forensics as well as forensics for non-standard devices such as mobile/smart phones, cloud computing and vehicular systems. Practical work will include labs where evidence is collected using tools and presented as well as the use, development and enhancement of these tools.

### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Use tools to carry out the steps involved in forensic science from collecting data to preserving evidence within the context of a framework for digital forensic evidence collection and processing, and present this information to a non-specialist audience.
2. Understand the technical details of filesystems and networks and apply this understanding to the construction and evaluation of new forensics tool functionality.
3. Critically evaluate evidence obtained using digital forensics methods based upon knowledge of evidential requirements as well as technical knowledge of operating systems, networks and non-standard devices such as mobile/smart phones, cloud computing and vehicular systems.
