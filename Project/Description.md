# Project

Given the contents of three computers from individuals suspected to be involved in drug smuggling, find evidence connecting the three individuals to the drug case. This involved finding discord and email caches which included hints towards conversations between the three individuals. One of the individuals was an undercover cop and had hacked another's laptop to record the keystrokes, allowing us to discover their passwords. 

Write a report explaining what happened, presenting evidence and where it was found.
