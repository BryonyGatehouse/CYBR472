# Lab 08: Metadata and Link File Analysis

In digital forensics, corroborative evidence that indicates that a file was accessed is just as important as the file itself. This lab explains what link files are, the different types, and how to extract valuable data from them.

## Objectives
- Learn the difference between file system metadata and embedded metadata
- Understand what data link files store and how to extract them
- Learn how to use link file metadata to determine if files were executed and where they were stored
