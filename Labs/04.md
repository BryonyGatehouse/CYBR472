# Lab 04: Registry Forensics

Forensic artifacts can be found in many areas of the Windows operating system. The registry hives are a hierarchical database that stores user settings and configuration data from installed software. The registry files hold some of the most valuable artifacts that can be used to identify user activity. The data can also be correlated with files found on the source device or other related evidence items.

## Objectives
- Identify the location of the most common registry files
- Learn what type of data each one stores
- Learn how to parse them
- Understand how to corroborate findings in the registry with files on the source device
