# Lab 07: Data Carving

Data recovery can be considered a facet of digital forensics. Potential evidence gets deleted all the time and may linger in unallocated space. To access these files, advanced data recovery methods known as data carving must be used. This process involves identifying certain characters, called file signatures, in seemingly nonsensical data. This lab offers multiple examples of file signatures and teaches how to carve the data out.

## Objectives
- How to identify files using signatures
- How to manually carve files using a hex editor
- How to use an automated tool to perform data carving
