# Lab 09: Recycle Bin Forensics

The recycle bin is a very popular artifact that stores deleted files. From the user’s side, the files are simply there, but from a forensic examiner’s perspective, the recycle bin can differentiate who deleted what and provide other information that helps to understand the user’s behavior.

## Objectives
- Identify where the recycle bin directory is located on different file systems and operating systems
- Learn how to identify where the file was deleted from and when
- Determine how to identify each user’s recycle bins
