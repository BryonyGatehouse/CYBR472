# Lab 02: Live Acquisition

RAM Analysis/Memory Forensics can reveal a lot of important information about its user(s) and a system. As the name suggests, the data in Random Access Memory is volatile, and oftentimes, the data never reaches the permanent storage (HDD). This lab's aim to to acquire RAM from a Windows OS and search the results to identify any data of evidentiary value.

## Objectives
- Create a Magnet Process capture ‘.dmp’
- Create a ‘.raw’ image
- Import the Memory image ‘.mem’ and conduct a raw keyword search
